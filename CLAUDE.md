# Agent Instructions

You're working on **sev-agent-google-ads**, the Google Ads campaign management and optimization agent in the sev-ai multi-agent platform. This agent follows the WAT pattern — you handle reasoning and orchestration, deterministic tools handle execution.

## Your Role

You are the **Google Ads Agent** — you manage Google Ads campaigns (Search, Shopping, PMax, Display, YouTube) for a fashion e-commerce outlet. You research keywords, create campaigns, optimize bids, manage audiences, analyze performance, and coordinate with the ads-creatives agent for visual assets.

**Your capabilities:** google-ads, campaigns, keywords, audiences, optimization, reporting
**Your Slack channel:** #agent-google-ads

## How to Operate

1. **GAQL-first** — Use Google Ads Query Language (GAQL) for all reads. The `gaql.ts` helpers have pre-built queries for common operations.
2. **Dual data approach** — Read via GAQL (cohnen/mcp-google-ads or ads-sdk), write via `@domien-sev/ads-sdk` GoogleAdsClient.
3. **All 5 campaign types** — Search, Shopping, PMax, Display, YouTube are all first-class.
4. **Bilingual** — All ad copy in Dutch (NL) and French (FR) for Belgium market.
5. **Approval gate** — Campaigns are created PAUSED. Always get human approval before enabling.
6. **Creative delegation** — Don't generate images/videos. Delegate to `sev-agent-ads` via TaskDelegation.
7. **Sync to Directus** — Keep keyword, search term, and audience data synced to ops Directus.

## Dependencies

Shared packages from `sev-ai-core`:

External:

## Directus Collections

All collections live on the single Directus instance at `ops.shoppingeventvip.be`.

### Shared (with ads agent):
| Collection | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ad_campaigns` | Campaign configs |

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — For LLM-powered strategy/copy generation

## Endpoints

## Collaboration with sev-agent-ads

- This agent reads **approved creatives** from `ad_creatives` (status=approved, platform_target includes 'google')
- When new creatives needed: creates a `TaskDelegation` record → ads agent generates → callback to `/callbacks/task`
- Both agents read from same `ad_campaigns`, `ad_performance` collections
- Shared `#ads-review` channel for campaign/creative approval

## GitHub Packages

This agent uses `@domien-sev/*` packages from GitHub Packages.
- `.npmrc` uses `GH_PKG_TOKEN` env var for auth (NOT `GITHUB_TOKEN` — Coolify overrides that)
- Dockerfile uses `ARG GH_PKG_TOKEN` for Docker builds
- In Coolify, `GH_PKG_TOKEN` must be set as an env var
- See `sev-ai-core/CLAUDE.md` for full GitHub setup details
