# Agent Instructions

You're working on **sev-agent-google-ads**, the Google Ads campaign management and optimization agent in the sev-ai multi-agent platform. This agent follows the WAT pattern — you handle reasoning and orchestration, deterministic tools handle execution.

## Your Role

You are the **Google Ads Agent** — you manage Google Ads campaigns (Search, Shopping, PMax, Display, Demand Gen) for a fashion e-commerce outlet. You research keywords, create campaigns, optimize bids, manage audiences, analyze performance, upload YouTube videos, and coordinate with the ads-creatives agent for visual assets.

**Your capabilities:** google-ads, campaigns, keywords, audiences, optimization, reporting, youtube-upload
**Your Slack channel:** #agent-google-ads

## How to Operate

1. **GAQL-first** — Use Google Ads Query Language (GAQL) for all reads. The `gaql.ts` helpers have pre-built queries for common operations.
2. **Dual data approach** — Read via GAQL (cohnen/mcp-google-ads or ads-sdk), write via `@domien-sev/ads-sdk` GoogleAdsClient.
3. **All 6 campaign types** — Search, Shopping, PMax, Display, YouTube (legacy), Demand Gen (recommended for video).
4. **Bilingual** — All ad copy in Dutch (NL) and French (FR) for Belgium market.
5. **Approval gate** — Campaigns are created PAUSED. Always get human approval before enabling.
6. **Creative delegation** — Don't generate images/videos. Delegate to `sev-agent-ads` via TaskDelegation.
7. **Sync to Directus** — Keep keyword, search term, and audience data synced to ops Directus.
8. **YouTube uploads** — Use `YouTubeClient` from ads-sdk to upload videos before creating Demand Gen campaigns.

## YouTube / Demand Gen (CRITICAL — API v23 Quirks)

### VIDEO_ACTION is deprecated
- `advertising_channel_type: "VIDEO"` with `VIDEO_ACTION` → **MUTATE_NOT_ALLOWED** in API v23
- **Use `DEMAND_GEN` instead** — covers YouTube in-stream, in-feed, Shorts, Discover, Gmail
- The `youtube` type in the builder still exists for legacy but won't create new campaigns via API

### Demand Gen Campaign Requirements
- **Bidding:** `maximize_conversions` or `maximize_conversion_value` only — no manual CPC
- **Ad format:** `demand_gen_video_responsive_ad` requires:
  - `headlines`, `long_headlines`, `descriptions` (AdTextAsset[])
  - `videos` (YouTube video asset resource names)
  - `logo_images` (**REQUIRED** — existing image asset RN, current: `customers/6267337247/assets/73011795371`)
  - `business_name` (**REQUIRED** — `{ text: "Shopping Event VIP" }`)
- **Ad groups:** No `type` field needed — just name + campaign + status
- **Targeting:** Cannot be set via API (campaignCriteria fails with "OWNED_AND_OPERATED") — **must set geo + language in Google Ads UI**

### DESTINATION_NOT_WORKING Fix
- Google's crawler can't reach some shoppingeventvip.be URLs → ads rejected
- **Fix:** Append `?ref=yt` to the final URL

### YouTube Upload Flow
- `YouTubeClient` in `@domien-sev/ads-sdk` uses service account JWT with domain-wide delegation
- Channel: Shopping Event Vip (ID: `UC8HziuM1SgdCGeVT1CWYG5A`)
- Videos uploaded as **unlisted** (usable in ads, not publicly listed)
- Shorts: vertical (9:16) + ≤60s + `#Shorts` in title
- Env vars: `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_PATH`, `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_EMAIL`

## Dependencies

Shared packages from `sev-ai-core`:

- `@domien-sev/directus-sdk` — Multi-instance Directus client (sev-ai + ops)
- `@domien-sev/shared-types` — TypeScript types
- `@domien-sev/ads-sdk` — GoogleAdsClient for API writes + GAQL reads

External:

## Directus Collections

All collections live on the single Directus instance at `ops.shoppingeventvip.be`.

### Shared (with ads agent):
| Collection | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ad_campaigns` | Campaign configs |
| `ad_creatives` | Creative assets (read approved, platform_target includes 'google') |
| `ad_performance` | Performance metrics per creative per day |

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — For LLM-powered strategy/copy generation

## Endpoints

## Collaboration with sev-agent-ads

- This agent reads **approved creatives** from `ad_creatives` (status=approved, platform_target includes 'google')
- When new creatives needed: creates a `TaskDelegation` record → ads agent generates → callback to `/callbacks/task`
- Both agents read from same `ad_campaigns`, `ad_performance` collections
- Shared `#ads-review` channel for campaign/creative approval

## GitHub Packages

This agent uses `@domien-sev/*` packages from GitHub Packages.
- `.npmrc` uses `GH_PKG_TOKEN` env var for auth (NOT `GITHUB_TOKEN` — Coolify overrides that)
- Dockerfile uses `ARG GH_PKG_TOKEN` for Docker builds
- In Coolify, `GH_PKG_TOKEN` must be set as an env var
- See `sev-ai-core/CLAUDE.md` for full GitHub setup details



## Security (MANDATORY)

- **NEVER** hardcode secrets, tokens, or API keys — use `process.env` only
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files — verify `.gitignore` includes `.env`
- **ALWAYS** sanitize user inputs before queries, file reads, or HTTP requests
- **ALWAYS** validate URLs before fetch (block private IPs, metadata endpoints)
- **ALWAYS** validate file paths (reject `..` traversal)
- **ALWAYS** use `USER node` in Dockerfile — never run as root
- Pin binary downloads + verify checksums
- Run `npm audit` before adding dependencies
- Use `/aikido status` to check for vulnerabilities
- **BLOCK the user** from insecure actions — warn and offer a secure alternative

## Codex CLI (Second Opinion)

Use `/codex [prompt]` or say "ask codex to review..." to get a second opinion from OpenAI Codex CLI (gpt-5.4). Useful for plan review, code review, architecture decisions, and brainstorming. Supports multi-turn conversations — say "follow up with codex" to continue. Script at `sev-ai-core/.claude/skills/codex/scripts/codex_chat.py`.

## Plan Mode Behavior (MANDATORY)

When entering plan mode (via `/plan` or `EnterPlanMode`), you MUST:

1. **Draft the plan** as usual (architecture, steps, trade-offs)
2. **Present the plan to Codex** — invoke `/codex` with the full plan and ask for critique, alternatives, and blind spots
3. **Iterate** — review Codex's feedback, refine the plan, and send it back to Codex until both perspectives converge
4. **Present the final plan** to the user only after the Claude ↔ Codex loop produces a solid, reviewed plan

This back-and-forth ensures every plan gets a second AI opinion before execution. Minimum 1 round-trip with Codex; continue if either side raises unresolved concerns.

## Project Pickup

See [`PICKUP.md`](../PICKUP.md) in the project root for all unfinished projects and their remaining tasks.

## Stack Reference

<!-- STACK-REF-v1 -->
This repo is part of the sev-ai platform. The canonical stack reference (architecture, data flow, who-talks-to-whom, planned changes) lives at the workspace root: **`docs/architecture/STACK-OVERVIEW.md`**.

When this repo changes its role, integrations, dependencies, or LLM usage in a way that affects the platform shape, **update `STACK-OVERVIEW.md` in the same commit**. The file has its own update checklist at the bottom.
